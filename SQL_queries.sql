Use the ORDER BY modifier to order tables by specific SELECT statements
Use the ASC and DESC modifiers to sort queries in ascending or descending order
Use the LIMIT modifier to determine the number of records to retrieve from a dataset
Use the BETWEEN modifier to retrieve records that contain a value that is within a given range
Use the NULL data type keyword to insert new records into a table
Use the COUNT function to count the number of records that meet a certain condition
Use the GROUP BY function to group your results according to the values in a given column

SQL QUERY

The term "query" refers to any SQL statement that retrieves data from your database

1.ORDER BY
 This modifier allows us to order the table rows returned by a certain SELECT statement.
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
ie SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age;
When using ORDER BY, the default is to order in ascending order. If we want to specify though, we can use ASC for "ascending" or DESC for "descending."
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC;

 2. LIMIT

SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;
returns all of the cats in order from oldest to youngest. Setting a LIMIT of 1 returns just the first, i.e. oldest, cat on the list.

3 .BETWEEN
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

4. NULL

 We can add data with missing values using the NULL keyword.
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (NULL, NULL, "Tabby");
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name IS NULL;

5.COUNT

COUNT will count the number of records that meet a certain condition.
SELECT COUNT([column name]) FROM [table name] WHERE [column name] = [value];
SELECT COUNT(owner_id) FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;

6. GROUP BY

GROUP BY is a great function for aggregating results into different segments
SELECT breed, owner_id, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed, owner_id;
SELECT breed, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed;

7.SELECT
SELECT name FROM cats;
Might be written as like this as well;
SELECT cats.name FROM cats;
SELECT cats.name, dogs.name FROM cats, dogs;
